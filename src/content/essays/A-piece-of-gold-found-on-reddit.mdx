Over the last few months, I've finally reached the lowest point of social media consumption and general non-work internet use in years, and I feel great about it. I've stopped checking the news, I've blocked various sites on my phone that would otherwise occupy my commutes and waits, and as a result, I have much more time to think and ponder.

Yesterday, however, I found myself on reddit to sell some things on my local city's very active subreddit, and unsurprisingly, while pulling reddit up to check my messages, I was briefly sucked in to it's siren call.

The post that caught my eye was one on the /r/Entrepreneur subreddit, which is, more often than not, full of spam and junk.

A user had made a post about being a broke entrepreneur who was venturing out to build in public.

The post itself was of little interest, but scrolling through the comments to try and get a gauge on the sentiment of that community for posts like this, I came across a glimmering shiny thing at the bottom of my pan.

What follows caught me by surpriseâ€”because it moved me.

> Every person who has ever started a startup is actively going broke. You're not unique; running down the runway is part of the game.\
> \
> You'll find that most ordinary people are inclined to join the peanut gallery and say "See? We told you it was hard. \
> You should've had a better plan." Forgive them, on the account that they've either given up themselves in the past, or they've never had the guts to start something on their own. As Mark Twain says, "only the great will make you feel that you too can become great."\
> \
> That said, you're probably going to need much more time than you're estimating, to get to revenue. It looks as if others get to greatness in months, but it takes years. It may take two years, sometimes five years, even ten years. But never six months.\
> \
> This creates a dilemma, because we're always told greatness requires fulltime commitment and a heroic effort. How can an ordinary startup with meager savings and a non-existent revenue stream endure that path?\
> \
> This is where ordinary people make the biggest mistake. A startup is not a Delaware registered company. A startup is an ordinary person who puts his fulltime commitment into achieving greatness. The startup company may die in the process, but the startup of you will only have begun.\
> \
> Do what you need to do to preserve yourself. Keep the company going if you want to, or take a job. Keep the idea, or dump the idea. Those things are not the startup you're building.\
> \
> The startup you're truly building is you.
