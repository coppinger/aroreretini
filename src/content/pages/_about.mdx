Kia ora, my name is Charlie Coppinger and this is my personal site—a place for me to record my adventures.

I live in Wellington, Aotearoa (New Zealand), where I’ve resided for the last 10 years. I’m originally from Shrewsbury, England.

I'm a serial founder and a jack of all trades: UI/UX design, marketing, front-end, product.
