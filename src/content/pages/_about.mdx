Kia ora, my name is Charlie Coppinger and this is my personal siteâ€”a place for me to record my adventures.

I'm a serial founder and jack of all trades: product designer, full stack developer and early growth marketer.

I've lived in Wellington, Aotearoa (New Zealand), for the last 10 years, but I've recently left for Europe. I grew up Shrewsbury, England.
