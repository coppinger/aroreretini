  * August 2020
    * I had the idea for Bookstop after reading the work of BJ Fogg & James Clear.
  * September 2020
    * I posted on the Indie Hackers forum seeking a technical co-founder to turn the MVP I had designed into a reality.
    * Here’s the video I posted (on IndieLog!):
      * https://indielog.com/video/x-post-to-indiehackers---looking-for-a-technical-co-founder-8cb39a2b
    * I connected and partnered up with an amazing iOS dev, Bryan, who was working at Twitter at the time.
  * October 2020
    * Bryan and I released an initial iOS version of Bookstop and began early marketing and user testing.
    * Shortly after, Bryan respectfully bowed out. He would end up visiting me in New Zealand a couple of years later, and we’re still close friends to this day.
  * October 2022
    * After a two year long hiatus, I returned to the idea of Bookstop. This time, I was determined to do it myself!
    * I built a scrappy MVP in \*vanilla\* Javascript :’)
  * May 2023
    * A further 7 months later, I teamed up with a good friend to bring a more fleshed out ‘v0.2’ of Bookstop to the world. To be continued...
