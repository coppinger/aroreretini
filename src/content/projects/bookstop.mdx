  For now, there isn’t one. Bookstop will be free while we’re still
  experimenting and trying to determine if it’s a useful tool.

  ### August 2020


  I had the idea for Bookstop after reading the work of BJ Fogg & James Clear.


  ### September 2020


  I posted on the Indie Hackers forum seeking a technical co-founder to turn the
  MVP I had designed into a reality.


  Here’s the video I posted (on IndieLog!):

  I connected and partnered up with an amazing iOS dev, Bryan, who was working
  at Twitter at the time.


  ### October 2020


  Bryan and I released an initial iOS version of Bookstop and began early
  marketing and user testing.


  Shortly after, Bryan respectfully bowed out. He would end up visiting me in
  New Zealand a couple of years later, and we’re still close friends to this
  day.


  ### October 2022


  After a two year long hiatus, I returned to the idea of Bookstop. This time, I
  was determined to do it myself!


  I built a scrappy MVP in \*vanilla\* Javascript :’)


  ### May 2023


  A further 7 months later, I teamed up with a good friend to bring a more
  fleshed out ‘v0.2’ of Bookstop to the world. To be continued...
