# Creating Dwarf

## 1. Learning

In August, I decided I wanted to try and pick up [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a Javascript component framework—I'd heard lots of good things about it, from lots of wonderfully smart people whom I admire and respect. When enough of these kinds of folks recommend something, I tend to pull the trigger.

If I've learnt anything about learning, or more specifically, how I learn, it's that building something is the optimal way to learn. Building, as opposed to just following tutorials/reading docs, allows me to piece together context in a much faster fashion, with much better recall.

Simply put, building makes concepts much easier to grok!

As such, setting out to learn Svelte, I almost immediately looked for a simple but relevant idea I could work on in order to learn as optimally as possible.

I quickly landed on the idea of creating a simple domain name marketplace, with a slight twist: instead of existing to cater to the listing and sales of highly valuable domains, my marketplace would cater to folks like me who accidentally hoarded domains after buying them for projects that never saw the light of day.

So, with an idea in mind, I set out to bring it to life, diving into plenty of Svelte, SvelteKit & Supabase learning resources—docs, tutorials and YouTube videos.

Not only that, I had the privilege of many wonderful folks [from my stream](https://twitch.tv/thecoppinger) helping me as I went, too, including the legendary [Huntabyte.](https://twitter.com/huntabyte/)

Within a week, I'd covered a lot of ground, and I was absolutely hooked. Compared to React, Svelte felt like a perfectly cool breeze on a warm summers day; that is to say, it was extremely refreshing.

## 2. Building

As ever, the first thing I did was jump into FigJam and map out the basics of a userflow, different data types and a rough wireframe of the screens.

Once I had a rough idea of what I was creating, I moved on to designing a set of mockups in Figma
