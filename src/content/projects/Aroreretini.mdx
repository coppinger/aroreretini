  A place to call home; I wanted to create a personal site to better capture my
  adventures and learning's. This site is the fruit of that labor!
---

Behold, the finished product! It took a few months, but I got this site built.

This site was made using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Astro](astro.build/) & [Tina](tina.io/).

Like the look of it? Please, take it!

[https://github.com/coppinger/aroreretini](https://github.com/coppinger/aroreretini)

I built the site using Tina CMS, a free and open source headless CMS that makes it easy and visual to edit the content, in the hopes that if anyone (even non-technical folks) liked the look if it and wanted to make their own similar site, they could do so.

If you'd like some help getting it setup, [don't hesitate to reach out](aroreretini.dev/contact)â€”I'd be delighted to help you.

Now to start posting content here on a semi-regular basis...
