Alright, another month, another project.

I recently re-connected with a friend I met through Twitch, a talented and highly driven developer called Noel.

Noel asked me for some feedback on a project he'd been working on with his friend Harry, so we hopped on a call and he took me through everything.

Well, a few hours and a pivot later, we emerged from a Discord call with the plan of building a micro social network!
