Three years ago, at the ripe old age of 25, I set out to try and learn the piano.

As a child, my father had me take piano lessons, which I did on and off .

I fondly remember him sharing with me why he wished for me to learn the piano:

"I've been to many restaurants and bars with a piano; it's always the guy who can play them that gets the girls."

Sage wisdom.

Far from any desire to increase my standing with the opposite sex, my ambitions were much simpler: I wanted to feel what I imagined it felt like to be able to play an instrument.

Learning anything as an adult can be somewhat intimidating, having left the safe and constructive confines of a world of educational systems and institutions. None the less, after years of hoping to pick up the piano at some obscure and undefined point in future, I set out to make it so.

My first port of call, like any terminally online nerd, was to post on a piano sub-reddit. By doing so, I connected with a lovely young man in India who was an exceptionally talented musician, and off we went.

The lessons went well in the sense that my teachers was excellent and I was keen to learn, but the format of being taught via Zoom was far from ideal, and the timezone related issues were difficult to navigate, too.

Within a month I was back on my own, but nevertheless determined to continue. I did so by doubling down on YouTube videos and started dabbling in a selection of apps, out of the vast number offered.

Now a year into embarking on my ivory quest, and frustrated with my slow progress, I started searching for a local teacher. I couldn't quite find any sites or teachers that stood out, but I decided to pick one and give it a shot.

Unfortunately, these local lessons didn't go particularly well for me. The teacher was, I have no doubt, very experienced, but the format didn't work well for me, nor did the curriculum that the teacher started with.

Once again, I found myself on my own. More apps, more YouTube videos. I pressed on.

At some point on this journey, I had happened across a beautiful old wooden piano in a charity shop not far from the building where I rent a room to serve as an office, which my friends and I now affectionately call 'the [Skunkworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works)'.

I decided then and there to purchase the piano and leave it in the lobby of the office buildingâ€”I'd spent the summer playing on a public piano, and had fallen deeply in love with the phenomenon of hearing strangers play the piano.

Despite the close proximity, getting the piano back to the office building was no small task. I borrowed a dolly and recruited a young art student (for $50) from a nearby park to help me roll it down the road.

Not long after I'd left the piano in the lobby, the residents of the building and I all received an email from management:

> **Subject:** Leaving things in the lobby\
> Please stop leaving things in the lobby or you will be forced to pay any removal fees.\
> \
> The piano can stay.

Sometimes, as they say, it's better to ask forgiveness than for permission. The piano was there to stay.

Over the last year and a half or so of the piano being in the lobby, there have been many spectacular days, when, with what joy and jubilation, I have come across total strangers playing on the piano. It's truly wonderful, and it never gets old.

Growing increasingly inspired by such moments, I began to flirt with the idea of organizing a community piano night, and a few months ago, I put that plan into action.

The format is quite simple: I make a mulled wine on a portable cooker, and a small but wonderful group of local musicians rock up to jam, sing and have a good time.

Through running the piano nights, I met Ani.
